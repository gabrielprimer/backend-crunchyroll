## Project Overview

This document outlines the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and Architectural Decision Records (ADR) for the backend application.

### 1. PRD (Product Requirements Document)

#### 1.1. Introduction

This backend application serves as the core data management and API layer for a content platform. It will handle data related to various content types (e.g., movies, episodes, anime), user interactions, and any business logic required by the platform.

#### 1.2. Goals

* Provide a robust and scalable API for the frontend and other services.
* Manage data persistence and retrieval efficiently.
* Implement necessary business logic for content management and user interactions.
* Ensure security and data integrity.

#### 1.3. Target Audience

* Frontend developers building user interfaces for the content platform.
* Other backend services that require access to content data.

#### 1.4. Features

* **Content Management:**
    * CRUD operations for movies, episodes, and anime.
    * Data validation and sanitization.
    * Relationships between different content types (e.g., episodes belonging to a movie).
* **API:**
    * GraphQL API for flexible data querying.
    * Well-defined data schemas.
    * Authentication and authorization (if required).
* **Data Persistence:**
    * Reliable database integration.
    * Data migration and versioning.

#### 1.5. Non-Functional Requirements

* **Scalability:** The application should be able to handle increasing amounts of data and user traffic.
* **Performance:** API responses should be fast and efficient.
* **Security:** Protect against common vulnerabilities and ensure data privacy.
* **Maintainability:** Code should be well-structured and documented for easy maintenance and future development.
* **Reliability:** The application should be highly available and fault-tolerant.

### 2. ADR (Architectural Decision Records)

#### 2.1. ADR 1: Technology Stack

**Decision:** We will use the following technology stack for the backend application:

* **Language:** Go (Golang) - Chosen for its performance, concurrency support, and strong standard library.
* **Framework:**  [Specify the framework, e.g., Gin, Fiber, Echo] -  [Provide the rationale for choosing this framework]
* **Database:** [Specify the database, e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL] - Chosen for [Provide the rationale for choosing this database, e.g., relational data, scalability, specific features].
* **GraphQL Library:** [Specify the library, e.g., gqlgen, graphql-go] - [Provide the rationale for choosing this library]
* **Authentication/Authorization:** [Specify the method, e.g., JWT, OAuth] - [Provide the rationale for choosing this method or indicate if it's not implemented yet]

**Rationale:** This stack provides a good balance between performance, scalability, and developer productivity. Go is well-suited for building performant and concurrent APIs, and the chosen framework and libraries will streamline development.

#### 2.2. ADR 2: Data Modeling

**Decision:** We will use a relational database schema to model the content data. Key entities will include:

* `movies`: Stores information about movies (title, description, release date, etc.).
* `episodes`: Stores information about episodes, linked to movies or anime (title, episode number, etc.).
* `anime`: Stores information about anime series (title, description, etc.).
* [Add other entities as needed, e.g., users, genres]

**Rationale:** A relational database provides strong data consistency and allows for complex queries and relationships between data entities.

#### 2.3. ADR 3: API Design

**Decision:** The API will be implemented using GraphQL. This allows clients to request exactly the data they need, reducing over-fetching and improving performance.

**Rationale:** GraphQL provides flexibility and efficiency in data retrieval, making it well-suited for a content platform where different clients may have varying data requirements.

## Installation and Running Instructions

### Prerequisites

* Go (version 1.20 or later)
* [Database software, e.g., PostgreSQL]

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
```
bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <project_directory>
    
```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
```
bash
    go mod download
    
```
3.  **Configure the application:**
    *   Create a `config.yaml` file in the `config/` directory (or adjust the configuration method as per your application).
    *   Set the necessary configuration parameters, including database connection details, API port, etc.  See `config/config.go` for the expected configuration structure.

4.  **Database setup:**
    *   Create the database.
    *   Run migrations (if applicable, instructions depend on the migration tool used). Example if using goose:  `go run main.go migrate up`  (You'll likely need a separate migration command or tool.)

### Running the Application
```
bash
go run main.go
```
This will start the backend server. The API will be accessible at the configured port (default is likely 8080, but check your `config.yaml`). You can then interact with the GraphQL API using a tool like GraphiQL or a GraphQL client.

**Note:** Adapt the bracketed information (framework, database, GraphQL library, authentication method) and configuration steps with your project-specific details.  Also ensure any database migration steps are clearly explained based on the tools you are using.
